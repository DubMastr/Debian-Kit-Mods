from the following link, 1 Gh/s can be perchased for 0.26 USD per month?

about 10 Gh/s will net .01 bitcoin per month after 0.2% fee from above links
http://bitcoinminingcalculator.org/index.php?ghs=10&diff=10455720138.5&cdiff=10455720138.5&fee=0.2

worth of .01 bitcoin is $5.25349 USD as of 05/25/2014
http://bitcoinexchangerate.org/c/USD/.01

maitenance fees
	$2.60 = USD cost of running 10 Gh/s per month
	$5.25 = USD worth of coins per month if 0.01 bitcoins are mined
	$2.65 = USD profit after fees per month

	if $1.30 USD is re-invested into incresing the Gh/s by 5 per month then only $0.05 will be "profit" but after 10 months you'll have 60 Gh/s = 0.09 BTC = $47.52 per month.

or if just under 50% of profit is reinvested every month

Sounds to good to be true?
Upon closer inspection there is a fee per Gh/s that is charged seperate from the maitenace fee. This fee fluxuates basedon who the offer comes from and the amount/fraction of Gh/s thier willing to allow you to use that month.
Curently this aditinal fee is aroun 0.0071772 BTC = $4.11 per Gh/s
This means that this service costs more than it will pay out bassed on curent calculations of Gh/s = BTC mined.
10 Gh/s per month will cost $2.60 (0.00450 BTC) in maitenance fees plus $41.10 (0.071772 BTC) in market cost equaling $43.70 (0.07565 BTC) in costs and only mining $5.25 (0.01 BTC) worth of Bitcoins by the end of the month.
This leaves the buyer in a $38.45 (0.06656 BTC) debt by the end of the month if reilying souly on purchaced mining power.

However that being said thier pool doesn't aply any maitancence fees to hardware that you own and add to your list of workers manualy.
Furthermore they have the least amount of fees for transfering to your walet and there doesn't apier to be a minimum cap for trasfers.
And I supose if you're willing to play the trade game~

~ then be aware of the natural flucuations in price and how it relates to the curent/inpending date and how the maintenance fee is aplyed.
From what I've come to understand by studing the buy/sell and pre-order systems;
	~ look for cheep bulk amounts of Gh/s for pre-order
	~ upon reciving the new months perched hashes, devide them, one set to keep for a few days and some to emedieatly sell based on invested amount and bellow tend tips
	~ post those in the first group to sell at a price based on last months relitive date plus one to three days and the curently developing price trend
	~ continue doing this with the remaining hashes, setting the sale price based on last months price and curen trends and the total invested originaly
	~ doing this should cause you to recoop the amount you invested plus wile your sale orders are waiting for buyers those hashes will be mining for you passivly adding to you profits.
	~ consider setting the hashes that you've purchased to mine coins other than Bitcoin; deversifying your Crypto Curancy buying/selling power and enabling you to ride each set of tends.
	~ and if you have hardware that would be more profitable running 27/7 as a rented miner than for personal mining then be sure to inestigate this as an option for older mining rigs.

So is it a good service or scam or waist of time?
	I'd say it's a good service, the security methods (if followed) are the best I've seen for mining/trading Bitcoin. The maintance fee for rented hashes is acceptable because it means your "garentied" that hashing power even if the original hardware goes down.
	Sertainly not a scam but if you don't enjoy stock or curancy exchange rate trading (or don't know how those work) then you may have a bad experiance.
	Defenatly not a waist of time; using you're own hardware it's one of the best pools I've found to mine on and if you've dedicated hardware then more than likely some of it's power can be rented out for greater profit than what it would bring by mining souly for you.
