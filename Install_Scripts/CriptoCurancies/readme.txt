Notes
	More than likely unless you are willing to invest the few hundred dollars for the hardware this will not be very usefull.
	However if combined with a MPI option you maybe able to leverage multiple devices to work together.
	Curently this is outside the scope of this script pack, however, I am working on this so new users have the opertunanty to mine bitcoins.
	I'll be working on alternet cripto coins shortly so be sure to check back often.
