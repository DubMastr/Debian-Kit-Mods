Note for CexControl.py :-: ou will still need to clone the source files of the python written cex bot from.the bellow link
git clone https://github.com/Eloque/CexControl
~ then replace the original CexControl.py with this one and it should do what it use to but with LTC instead of NMC; arberage included!
