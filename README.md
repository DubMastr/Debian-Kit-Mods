Debian-Kit-Mods
===============

Scripts and methods of modifying ARM Linux distributions made available by Debian Kit for rooted Android devices will be uploaded here for others to quickly enable new features in their devices.
These scripts should work for any armel Linux distrobution based on debian.

These scripts where written under the following usernames"

To automate and make easy the processes of installing Java from source or tarball and Java dependent software.
Such as Maptools and jMonkey which wouldn't normally be able to run on ARM CPUs. But running Linux on Raspberry Pi or Android mobile devices bypasses much or all the nead to re-write a program to run happielly on ARM.

Modification instructions can be found under the "docs" directory.

###
# warning of pairale
# This is offered freely and without warranty
# users of these scripts may destroy everything they hold dear.
# security wile running Linux on Android should be conidered like running a full PC. 
# "sudo rm" on the Linux side will do the same as "su rm" irigardless of what directory or permitions.
# So be aware that the OS can be compermized and because the data 
# of the Android device is on the same hardware bothe can be compermized or distroid.

test results
~~~~~~
02152014 ARM_Java_JDK7_Istaller works again. (renamed to ARM_JDK7sf_Installer in preperation for other versions for hardfloat to be made)
02172014 ARM_Maptools_Installer works again.
02242014 ARM_Java7_Downloader now exsists and works.
02272014 FindScriptDirectory works as an example of what's to come
03012014 ARM_Linux_Moder now functions to run any of the scripts from this github project
	furthermore; the three new versions of ARM_Java_JDK7_Istaller, ARM_Maptools_Installer, and ARM_Java7_Downloader under the Install_Scripts 
	should all function corectly
03082014 ARM_NodeJS_Installer now works for Debian Kit; use option 3 to install through apt-get.
	note though that installing libc6-dev may kick you out of xrdp and ssh connections temperaraly wile it installs, but after a minuet or two everything will restart and you can reconect.
	options 1 and 2 are still untested as I don't have hard float running right now and the other option is for Pi soft float.
	for NoFlo enthusiest there is a final prompt to request permition to install noflo through npm.
03142014 findNetworking_IPs can now be used to learn about scripting for bash. Spicificly setting complex variables, saving and renaming and sending files, soon there will be a Part 3 to this script for sending files to a remote device.
	note this is to be viewed running in a terminal window and a text editing window so you can see everything that is happening and being referanced.
	note also that this is a test of "Scripting Lessions for Linux" searies that I plan on putting togeather in the Examples directory so people that are new to Linux and/or running Linux on Android may quickly benofit from the years of testing/learning I've done. I plan to orginize these into fully functional and usefull scripts that step the user (you the reader) through what is going on step-by-step so that the commands are understood enough that you can feel comfortable with modifying/playing-around with the examples for your own uses.
	Mainly this is because I only found one truely fantastic source of information on the main subject of this script but that was through the "way back" machien and though it was a good recource I believe this script will do a good job of introducing people to scripting for themself. And sometimes I too nead a refresher on what can be done with the command line on Linux and how much fun it can be when things just work :-D
