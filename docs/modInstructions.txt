	use these to modify the script so that it finds and sets up Java corectly on your device.
	for example, bellow, the sugested modds to the script would change things so java version 7u45 would be installed and find would be pointed to your external sdcard for finding the source .tar file.

for FindScriptDirectory
	~~~~~
	$ThisScript and $PathTo_ThisScript can be modifide for other uses or encorperation into other scripts.
	if using within a script that writes out its componits such as the ones found in this branch then the following lines;
3	ThisScript="$(readlink -f $0)"
	and
5	PathTo_ThisScript="$(dirname $ThisScript)"
	and
8	echo "The name of this script is : $ThisScript"
9	echo "The path to this script is : $PathTo_ThisScript"
	should be modifide to;
3	ThisScript="\$(readlink -f \$0)"
	and
5	PathTo_ThisScript="\$(dirname \$ThisScript)"
	and
8	echo "The name of this script is : \$ThisScript"
9	echo "The path to this script is : \$PathTo_ThisScript"
	in the "host script" so the variables are not prossessed during the writing out portion.
	This example will be used latter to modify some of the curent scripts and the new ones to come.
	 Perpios of this script example is to save the directory that it is running from into a variable that can be use latter,
	 reason why this is useful; allows script componits to find one another no matter where they may have been downloaded from. 
	~~~~~
for 2nd_debSetup
	This script should be run on the Android terminal and [b]not[/b] on your Linux terminal
	If you recieve errors or blank lines where there should be usefull info, then likely you do not have the Android Terminal app found at the following link;
	https://github.com/jackpal/Android-Terminal-Emulator
	I'll be adding links into this script to both the above source and Google Market Place link so users know the requirements.
	Note though that once the app is installed; the commands/programs that come with it can be accessed with other Android terminal apps, such as ROM Toolbox.
	...eventually, when I figure out the "am" command on Android, you will see a script that runs on Linux to preform similar and new tasks; opening an app, rebooting, backing up a file, saving and running a script, remotely or localy but from the Linux commandline to controle your Android device...
If you have issues with this script after installing BusyBox, then likely you'll want to edit the inital commands for your terminal emulator to point to the "xbin" directory that the BusyBox installer installs to by default. See bellow example of what I'm running on my tablet to get the "ifconfig" and other fetures of this script to function.
	__________
	export PATH=/data/local/bin:$PATH
	export PATH=/system/xbin:$PATH
	__________
	Now your command line interface has many more fetures.
