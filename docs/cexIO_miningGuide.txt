This document will explore how to best use https://cex.io/trade with personal hardware, traiding altcoins and cloud mining service.
	Note; do to the differences in mining software (cpuminer, cgminer, and others) the command examples are first given in a deconstructed form for easy copy/pasting before giving a compleat example that I would use. The first section you can treat as a "cheat sheat" for quickly setting up you hardware before getting into opinions.

	Mining with personal hardware can be acheived by using the following commands for thier respective pools
Coin 	| for cpuminer add "-a sha256d -o" for CPUMiner before bellow addresses
BTC 	|	stratum+tcp://uk1.ghash.io:3333
BTC 	| 	stratum+tcp://us1.ghash.io:3333

 		| for cpuminer add "-a scrypt -o" for CPUMiner before bellow addresses
LTC 	| 	stratum+tcp://ltc.ghash.io:3333
DOGE 	| 	stratum+tcp://doge.ghash.io:3333
FTC 	| 	stratum+tcp://ftc.ghash.io:3333
AUR 	| 	stratum+tcp://aur.ghash.io:3333
DRK 	| 	stratum+tcp://drk.ghash.io:3333
Multi 	| 	stratum+tcp://multi.ghash.io:3333

	Compleat comand examples for cpuminer; change "S0AndS0" to your user name and "workerTest" to whatever you like, but don't forget the "." between.
	Note; passwords for cex can be left blank in most casses.
BTC 	|	./minerd -a sha256d -o stratum+tcp://uk1.ghash.io:3333 -u S0AndS0.workerTest -p x
Multi 	|	./minerd -a scrypt -o stratum+tcp://multi.ghash.io:3333 -u S0AndS0.workerTest -p x

Fees and how they can bight into your wallet.
0.26 USD 	~=~ Maitenance fee per GH/s from cex 
0.001 *coin = Commission fee to manually withdraw any coin to another wallet from cex
	Note there shouldn't be a Commission fee if it's an auto withdraw but I've yet to find where to set that up
0.2 % BTC 	= traid fee paid by saller when buyer buys
	Note for sellers; this fee can cause you to have negivive ballance when traiding small values of coins, always dubble check youself befor conferming.

example of bad trade for seller
LTC 		| BTC 		| Total before fees | Total after fees
0.0000009 	| 0.0175 	| 0.00000002 		| ~= 0.00000001
example of better trade for seller
0.0001 		| 0.01747 	| 0.00000175 		| =
