Currently it looks as though to run bcmod on the Epic 4G you'll nead to be running CM7
	Unfortunetly CM10 on this device uses drivers differently so someone with a bit more know how may beet me to getting compatibility.
	However, I'm not about to assume that others will pick this up so I'll be working on it here too;
