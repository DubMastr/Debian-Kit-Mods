# notes and credits
# used PDF from following location
# http://docs.openstack.org/havana/install-guide/install/apt-debian/content/
# p 1-18 start
# the pdf guide sugests : ntp : to sync services and time between other nodes. The controller node is usually used as refferance to all other nodes.
# the pdf guide states that : mysql database : be installed on the controller node and mysql client software be installed to any nodes that access mysql. So Open Stack services can store informantion
#+	Furthermore it is sugested to answer : yes : to all prompts unless you've a good reason not to...
# on other nodes that don't host a mysql data base then : apt-get install ?mysql client and python library? : ...
# to install openstack : Havana : two options are listed : backports or moving to sid : see next four lines
# use backports for wheeze
# echo 'deb http://archive.gplhost.com/debian havana-backports main' | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports_openstack.list
# move to sid for Havana 
# echo 'deb http://archive.gplhost.com/debian havana main' | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sid_openstack.list
#+ then update and add keys with following command
# apt-get update && apt-get install gplhost-archive-keyring
#+	then update the package list again and upgrade your distro and reboot with following commands
# apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
# reboot 	# note for ARM Linux on Android running the following command under Android's terminal will do the same as the above reboot
# 			deb u; deb u && deb k && echo "Shut down compleat..Re-starting now..." && deb
